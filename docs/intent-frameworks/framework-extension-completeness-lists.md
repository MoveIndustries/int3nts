# Framework Extension Completeness Lists

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: When adding a new framework, ensure maximal completeness by implementing all tests listed in the respective completeness files below.**

These lists track alignment status by component category. The detailed test lists have been split into separate files located in their respective test directories for easier access during development.

All tests listed are VM-specific; generic tests are intentionally excluded because they are not relevant when integrating a new VM.

## VM Intent Framework

Escrow test alignment for VM intent framework contracts:

- See [`intent-frameworks/COMPLETENESS.md`](../../intent-frameworks/COMPLETENESS.md)

## Verifier

Test alignment for the trusted verifier:

- See [`trusted-verifier/tests/COMPLETENESS.md`](../../trusted-verifier/tests/COMPLETENESS.md)

## Solver

Test alignment for the solver:

- See [`solver/tests/COMPLETENESS.md`](../../solver/tests/COMPLETENESS.md)

## Frontend

Test alignment for the frontend:

- See [`frontend/src/COMPLETENESS.md`](../../frontend/src/COMPLETENESS.md)
